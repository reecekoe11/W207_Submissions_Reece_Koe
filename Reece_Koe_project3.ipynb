    "---\n",
    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively **dense** (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively **sparse** (represented as a **bag-of-words**). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "1. Comment your code.\n",
    "1. All graphs should have titles, label for each axis, and if needed a legend. It should be understandable on its own.\n",
    "1. All code must run on colab.research.google.com\n",
    "1. You should not import any additional libraries.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For several L1 regularization strengths ...\n",
    "  1. Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.\n",
    "  1. Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary . For this new model, use an **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  \n",
    "  1. Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "1. Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "1. How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",

    "ANSWER: The performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compared to the models based on full vocabulary vary across the different l1 strengths. In most cases, the f1 score is slighter higher for the models based on full vocabularies. This difference is so small in most cases, but the computation requirements are much lower with the reduced vocabularies. The only case when the larger vocabulary performed worse was when C=0.1, so the l1 regularization did not have a lot of pull on the weights."

Many of the words in these messages correlate with another topic, but there are a few words that set up the rest of the message. Because the majority of the message does not correlate with the correct topic, a min_df parameter could be implemented in the TfidfVectorizer.
